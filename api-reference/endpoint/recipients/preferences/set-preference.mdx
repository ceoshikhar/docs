title: "Set recipient's preference"
openapi: "PATCH /v1/recipients/{recipient_id}/preferences/targets"
---

The `target` here can be used to set a project pereference (global-level) or a (resource-level) preference.

You can use this API to :

-   Allow recipient to update their project preference on the "Notification's setting" screen.
-   Allow recipient to subscribe to something. Example, "Subscribe a channel on YouTube" via `target` like `yt_channel:mr_beast:new_video` with `subscribed: true`.
