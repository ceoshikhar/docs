These are the project preferences (global-level) of the recipient.
To create project preferences go to **Bodhveda Console > Preferences**.

ğŸ’¡ You should show these preferences on your "Notification's setting" screen where the recipient can see their current preferences and update them.

`inherited: false` means the recipient **has** overridden the preference for that `target` explicitly to whatever `subscribed` is right now.
