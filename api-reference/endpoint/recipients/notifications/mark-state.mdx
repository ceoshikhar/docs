title: "Update notifications state"
openapi: "PATCH /recipients/{recipient_id}/notifications"
---

Update the state of one or more notifications for a recipient.

-   If `ids` is omitted, the update will apply to **all notifications** for that recipient.
-   You can set one or multiple state fields in the same request.
-   Fields left out of `state` will remain unchanged.

**Available state fields:**

-   `read`: `true` means marked as read, `false` means marked as unread.
-   `opened`: `true` means the notification was opened, `false` means it is un-opened.

```json
{
    "ids": ["notif_123", "notif_456"],
    "state": { "read": true }
}
```
