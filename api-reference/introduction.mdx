## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Base URL

```
https://api.bodhveda.com
```

-   All endpoints in this documentation are relative to the `/v1` path.
-   For testing, a sandbox or staging environment may be available upon request.

## Authentication

All requests require the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

### API Key Scopes

There are 2 scopes for an API KEY:

-   **full** – Full access to all project-level APIs. Use only on the **server side**.
-   **recipient** – Limited-scope API keys intended for **client-side/browser** use. These allow a recipient to **fetch and manage only their own notifications and preferences**.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:**  
> If your `recipient_id` values are predictable (e.g., auto-incrementing integers), you **should not** expose `recipient`-scoped API keys on the frontend.  
> Instead, route requests through your own backend to ensure recipient access is properly scoped and protected.

### Authentication Errors

-   If the API key is missing or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
-   If the API key does not have sufficient permissions, you will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

## Response Structure

All responses follow this structure:

```json
{
    "status": "success", // or "error"
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "errors": [], // array of error objects, if any
    "data": {} // or [ ] response data, if any
}
```

#### Error Object

```json
{
    "message": "Short error message",
    "description": "Detailed technical description",
    "property_path": "field_name",
    "invalid_value": "the value that caused the error"
}
```

#### Example Error Response

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "status_code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request payload",
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Recipient ID is required",
            "description": "Recipient ID cannot be empty",
            "property_path": "recipient_id",
            "invalid_value": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

## Rate Limiting

-   The API enforces rate limits to prevent abuse.
-   If you exceed the allowed rate, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
-   Standard limit: 100 requests per minute for a project (subject to change).

## HTTP Status Codes

-   `200 OK` – Successful GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
-   `201 Created` – Successful POST (resource created)
-   `400 Bad Request` – Invalid input or malformed request
-   `401 Unauthorized` – Missing or invalid API key
-   `403 Forbidden` – Insufficient permissions
-   `404 Not Found` – Resource does not exist
-   `409 Conflict` – Resource already exists
-   `429 Too Many Requests` – Rate limit exceeded
-   `500 Internal Server Error` – Unexpected server error
