## Base URL

```
https://api.bodhveda.com
```

All endpoints in this documentation are prefixed with `https://api.bodhveda.com`.

## Authentication

All requests require the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key that looks like `bv_xxxxxxxxx`.

### API Key Scopes

There are 2 scopes for an API KEY:

-   **Full access** – All APIs are accessible with this scope. Use only on the **server side**.
-   **Recipient access** – All the recipient's API are accessible with this scope. Fetch and manage only their own notifications and preferences. Intended for **client-side/browser** use.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:**  
> If your `recipient_id` values are predictable (e.g., auto-incrementing integers), you **should not** expose `Recipient access` scoped API keys on the frontend.  
> Instead, route requests through your own backend to ensure recipient access is properly scoped and protected.

### Authentication Errors

-   If the API key is missing or invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
-   If the API key does not have sufficient permissions, you will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

## Response Structure

All responses follow this structure:

```json
{
    "status": "success", // or "error"
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "errors": [], // array of error objects, if any
    "data": {} // or [ ] response data, if any
}
```

## Response codes

Bodhveda uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `2xx`  | Successful request.                       |
| `400`  | Invalid input or malformed request        |
| `401`  | The API Key is missing or invalid.        |
| `403`  | The API key has insufficient permissions. |
| `404`  | The resource was not found.               |
| `409`  | The resource already exists.              |
| `429`  | The rate limit was exceeded.              |
| `5xx`  | Indicates an error with Bodhveda servers. |

## Rate Limiting

-   The API enforces rate limits to prevent abuse.
-   If you exceed the allowed rate, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
-   Standard limit: 100 requests per minute for a project (subject to change).
