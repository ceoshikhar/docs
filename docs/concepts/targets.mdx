A **target** defines _who should get a notification_ and _how it should be categorized_. It typically consists of:

-   **Channel**: Broad category (e.g., `posts`)
-   **Topic**: Subcategory or specific resource (e.g., `post_id_123`, `any`, or `none`)
-   **Event**: What happened (e.g., `new_comment`)

Targets are used for both sending notifications and managing recipient preferences.
