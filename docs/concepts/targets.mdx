A **target** defines _who should get a notification_ and _how it should be categorized_. It typically consists of:

-   **Channel**: Broad category (e.g., `posts`)
-   **Topic**: Subcategory or specific resource (e.g., `post_id_123`, `any`, or `none`)
-   **Event**: What happened (e.g., `new_comment`)

Targets are used for both sending notifications and managing recipient preferences.

#### `any` and `none` have special meaning:

-   `any` means **all topics under this channel/event**.
-   `none` means **only the base channel/event**.
-   `any` is **not** a valid `topic` when sending a notification, but both are valid for preferences.

A preference with the target `posts:any:new_comment` will match a notification with target `posts:post_id_123:new_comment`, but a preference with the target `posts:none:new_comment` will **only** match a notification with target `posts:none:new_comment`.
