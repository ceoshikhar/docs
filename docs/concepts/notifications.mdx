A **notification** is a message sent to a recipient about an event. Notifications can be:

-   **Direct**: Sent to a specific recipient.
-   **Broadcast**: Sent to all recipients subscribed to a target.

Notifications include a payload (custom data) and are categorized by their target.

A direct notification will always be delivered to the recipient unless the recipient has unsubscribed that target.

A broadcast notification will only be delivered to the recipients who are subscribed to the target.
