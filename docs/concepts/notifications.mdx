A **notification** is a message sent to a recipient about an event. Notifications can be:

-   **Direct**: Sent to a specific recipient.
-   **Broadcast**: Sent to all recipients subscribed to a target.

Notifications include a payload (custom data) and are categorized by their target.

A direct notification will always be delivered to the recipient unless the recipient has unsubscribed that target.

A broadcast notification will only be delivered to the recipients who are subscribed to the target.

#### How does Bodhveda determine if a recipient should receive a broadcast notification or not?

Let's assume a broadcast was sent for a new comment that was made on post with id `12345`. The target used for this broadcast is `posts:12345:new_comment`.

Bodhveda will lookup recipients who have subscribed to this target via either `posts:12345:new_comment` or via `posts:any:new_comment` target.

`any` has special behaviour in Bodhveda. Learn more about [targets](/docs/concepts/targets) and [preferences](/docs/concepts/preferences).
