**Preferences** let recipients control which notifications they receive. Preferences are set per target and can be:

-   **Inherited**: Using the project's default setting.
-   **Overridden**: Explicitly set by the recipient.

Use recipient's project preferences to build notification settings screens for your users.

If you want to build something like Reddit where an author is subscribed to their own post and any other user can explictly _follow_ someone else's post as well.

-   For the author, you can send a direct notification and it will always deliver unless the recipient explicity unsubscribe to that target. You should still use `target` so that you get analytics based on targets.

-   For the user who wants to follow someone else's post, you should subscribe the recipient to that target and if they unfollow the post, unsubscribe them from that target.

-   You could subscribe the author to their post's target so that whenever some event is triggered on that post, you can just send a broadcast notification and the author and the _other user_ both will recieve the notification.
